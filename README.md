- Now run Java program by passing class name HelloWorld (class name is case sensitive) as the command line argument and clicking on Run button, which executes your program and prints the string on the standard output, make sure your maintain the same case and not change
- Now try changing the code to print some more messages using statement System.out.println("<Type Your String Here>");, don't forget to compile each time you make code change
